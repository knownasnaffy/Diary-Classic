I made this app because I was too lethargic to write a diary on pages and also, I made many mistakes while writing. It didn't feel safe too as any random person can peek in it.
So that is the reason why I felt a need for an application on my PC.

I also thought that I am not the only one who is feeling that way. So I made it open source, as anyone can use it.
It also provides programmers a new idea for a project to work on. ðŸ’¡

## Important!
Today, an idea came to my mind, I have started this app just by a random thought and I never tried to see similar apps made by other people. So, I searched accross github and found many interesting results. I am also not a pro in python or any other such programming language too, due to which I think my app is not that good. I can definitely make it better and then best but I think I will need some experience. So, I am going to quite this apps development for some while. I am going to practice for some while and then continue where I left off. Till then, have a good time people.
