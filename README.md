# Diary

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v2.3.0-orange?style=for-the-badge) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/naffydharni006/Diary?style=for-the-badge) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/naffydharni006/Diary?style=for-the-badge) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/naffydharni006/Diary?style=for-the-badge) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/license/naffydharni006/Diary?style=for-the-badge)

I made this app because I was too lethargic to write a diary on pages and also, I made many mistakes while writing. It didn't feel safe too as any random person can peek in it.
So that is the reason why I felt a need for an application on my PC.

I also thought that I am not the only one who is feeling that way. So I made it open source, as anyone can use it.
It also provides programmers a new idea for a project to work on. ðŸ’¡

### What's New?
- Different storage folders for windows and linux (Came to my senses after a long time that I made this app not usable for non-windows users, so, this update solves the problem)
- Settings will now use json instead of dot-env (will be soon updated to some encrypted dbms)
- You can now use emojies
- Organised the code by dividing some parts into package modules

### Upcoming features:
- View previously written entries in the app.
- Edit previously written entries in the app.
- Protect app with a password
- Theme selection
- Any other features which will be provided by you ðŸ˜„
