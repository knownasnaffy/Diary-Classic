# Diary

I made this app because I was too lethargic to write a diary on pages and also, I made many mistakes while writing. It didn't feel safe too as any random person can peek in it.
So that is the reason why I felt a need for an application on my PC.

I also thought that I am not the only one who is feeling that way. So I made it open source, as anyone can use it.
It also provides programmers a new idea for a project to work on. ðŸ’¡
